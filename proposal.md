# Album Generator Proposal

1. The goal this website will achieve is entertainment and humor through generation of a band, album, and song list with a specified genre and theme using OpenAI.
2. The demographic for this site is the average internet user and music fans.
3. Data will be fictitious data generated by the OpenAI api.
4. a. My database will include Users(username, email, ect.), Bands (foreignkey on users), Albums (foreignkey on band), Songs (foreignkey on album), Likes, Tags, Follows
   b. The biggest issue in using the api is giving a good enough prompt to receive the most quality responses and ficticious data.
   c. sensitive info I needed to secure would be my API key and user's passwords.
